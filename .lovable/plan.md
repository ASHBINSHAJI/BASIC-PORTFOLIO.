## Add Gaming Project to Portfolio

### What's being added
A new project card for your **street-level racing game** in the Featured Projects section, marked as "Coming Soon."

### Project Card Details
- **Title**: Something like "Street Outlaws Racing" (or suggest a name you prefer)
- **Description**: A street-level illegal racing game (NFS-style) where players can exit their car to explore the city, visit dealerships, workshops, and home. Features a thrilling story mode, truck transport for cars, multiplayer/LAN play, a deep workshop system with blueprints and custom body kits, headlights, paint mixing, and a realistic petrol/diesel fuel system with pumps across the map.
- **Tags**: Gaming, Open World, Multiplayer, Racing
- **Gradient**: A dark red/black street-racing vibe (e.g., `from-red-600/20 to-gray-900/20`)
- **Status**: Coming Soon

### Technical Changes

**File: `src/components/portfolio/Projects.tsx`**
- Add a 5th project object to the `projects` array with the racing game details
- Update the subtitle text to mention "gaming" alongside the other ventures

### Notes
- The description will be a polished summary of your game concept, covering the key unique features (exit car, workshop blueprints, fuel system, multiplayer)
- If you have a specific name for the game, let me know and I'll use that instead
